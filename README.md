UnityForms
==========

UnityForms is a Editor GUI system with a heavy inspiration from WinForms

**Motivation**
Unity3D immediate mode GUI is not really well suited for creating nice editor interfaces for custom tools.
The drawing code pollutes the OnGUI method which also makes difficult to separate concerns.

UnityForms is a framework which tries to ease the creation of UIs in Unity editor windows. It is inspired in WinForms because of my previous experience and it is a very well know GUI framework.
